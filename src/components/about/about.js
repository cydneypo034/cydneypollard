                I love making people's ideas into tangible things that help them reach more people
                and increase their impact. Since I was a child, I have been an artist, but would get discouraged in pursuing it as a career path
                because of the fear of being a "starving artist" and I allowed comparison between myself and other classically trained artist to disrupt that pursue.
                I started working as a custodian at a theme park and realized that I was working in a job that I only took because I was afraid to pursue after what I 
                truly wanted. I began work to pursue a creative career and saw graphic design as an enjoyable passion. I also learned how to code and in the process, broke 
                the boundary I placed on myself that I wasn't able to learn anything that had to do with science.  With being a graphic designer, I 
                like being able to take people's ideas and make them into a reality. Now that I know how to code as a software developer, I can take 
                those ideas and take them a step further.
